I view life as a journey of learning to love my neighbors and myself, and delight in Christ.

This site is a collection of my thoughts proceeding's as I learn about humanity, theology, and ecology. As well as my enjoyment of technology.

### Humanity

The opportunity to live in community with those from all walks of life. To love everyone with equity. So we can all reach the equal outcomes of living safe, feed, and sheltered lives.

### Theology

I hold sadness and shame as I can now see I grew up in a fundamentalist view of Christianity. Where obedience was considered more important than living by the words of Christ. 

### Ecology

Growing up on a farm and working with hundreds of farmers in various arid regions over the years has allowed me to see what has positive and negative impacts on farmland and rainfall.

### Technology

Working in the world of Embedded Linux lets me play with many aspects of technology and apply it in ways which equips farmers to stewards the natural resources God has entrusted us to work with.
