Planterology is shutting down and ceased retail operations on December 31st 2023.

*As I have been evaluating my life this fall,  I am sad to realize I'm in a line of work others wanted me to do, and not really what I want to do. So to stop forcing myself to do work I don't enjoy doing, I need to shut down Planterology and step away from the ag space for a few years. I have enjoyed helping you all find better ways to establish your crop. But there are a lot of other dimensions to ensure you can run well which I can no longer force myself to do. ~Hans Jensen*
